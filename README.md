## ✨ Features

### 🌟 Interactive BST Operations
- **Node Insertion**: Add new nodes dynamically by entering values.
- **Random Tree Generation**: Auto-generate random BSTs with 4 to 10 nodes.
- **Undo/Redo**: Full history tracking to easily undo and redo tree operations.

### 🔍 Tree Traversal Visualizations
- **Inorder Traversal**: Left → Root → Right.
- **Preorder Traversal**: Root → Left → Right.
- **Postorder Traversal**: Left → Right → Root.
- **Step-by-step animation** of each traversal.
- **Visual node highlighting** during traversal to clearly show progress.

### 🎨 Advanced Visualization
- **SVG-based dynamic tree rendering** for smooth and high-quality visuals.
- **Animated edge connections** to enhance visual clarity.
- **Color-coded nodes**:
  - **Current node** (Pink)
  - **Visited nodes** (Blue)
  - **Unvisited nodes** (Green)
- **Height and depth display** for each node, aiding understanding of the tree structure.

### 🖥️ Navigation & Controls
- **Pan & Zoom**: Easily explore the tree structure.
- **Reset View**: Return to the default tree view for better navigation.
- **Animation Speed Control**: Adjust the speed of animations (0.5x - 2x) for preferred pacing.
- **Export Options**: Save the tree structure as PNG or JSON for sharing or analysis.

### 🎭 UI/UX Enhancements
- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**: Switch between dark and light modes based on preference.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Animated gradients & Glassmorphism UI**: Aesthetic and modern UI design.
- **Auto-hiding Navbar on Scroll**: Maximizes screen space and improves navigation.

### 💡 Educational Elements
- **Real-time feedback** during operations, providing instant insights.
- **Clear visualization of tree relationships** for easy understanding of BST behavior.
- **Height & depth information** per node to illustrate the tree's structure effectively.

## ⚙️ Technical Stack
- **React + TypeScript**: Modern frontend development for enhanced performance and maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.
- **SVG-based tree rendering**: For high-quality and dynamic visualizations.
- **State management**: Efficiently handles tree operations and updates.
- **Optimized animations & performance**: Smooth transitions and performance-focused design.
